# Airlines Ticket Price Analysis

## Objective

As an aviation enthusiast, I always look forward to flying whenever I plan to travel. Since the Covid-19 pandemic ended, aviation market began to recover slowly from rock bottom ticket prices in peak of pandemic. With the war in Ukraine and rise in ATF prices, ticket prices have been through the roof reaching new high. As a result of this, I decided to do an exploratory data analysis for ticket prices to better understand the factors affecting them in India.
I aim to answer questions like No. of flights available across India, Ticket availability across different class, Price range across different class, etc.
